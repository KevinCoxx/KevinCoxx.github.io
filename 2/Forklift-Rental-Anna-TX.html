<p>Body lift kits are primarily used to lift up a truck or SUV either two or three inches higher. OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years. This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent.</p>

A large suv or more often truck that has had longer suspension components nailed on it to increase ground clearance. Instead, body kits are primarily used just for style enhancements.

The W-series also includes five other versatile pallet trucks with a load capacity up to 2.5 tonnes, making them suitable for all manner of material handling, including horizontal transportation and order picking.</p>

<p>Five new forklift models - with load capacities from 1.4 - 2.5 tons - deliver class-leading performance, and lift heights up to 13 metres.
