<p>BJ's Rentals, Inc. Here at East Midlands Forklifts , we provide comprehensive forklift training for a variety of trucks and at various levels. An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load. Two lifting-fork order pickers allow the operator to vary the load height to reduce the need for reaching and bending.</p>
<p>That's why our focus is making the forklift rental process quick and easy, without the usual red tape and fine print of the big rental companies. The 37-inch-wide C-G chassis—about five to six inches narrower than the chassis of a typical 4,000 to 7,000 lb. forklift—allows C-G Series forklifts to navigate tight rack storage aisles. Our stores in Sacramento, CA and throughout northern central California are fully equipped to meet your demands for rental forklifts.</p>

With a solid schedule of consistent and high-quality maintenance, your forklift can be relied upon to provide years of worry-free performance.
