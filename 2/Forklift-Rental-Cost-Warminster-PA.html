Layman's Terms: Off-roading is fun, until you have to be towed 30 miles to a shop when your driveshaft falls out because you just had to have the huge lift. If you lift a load too high, you can cause the forklift to tip over. As time has passed, forklifts have tended to specialization.</p>
<p>We provide good condition usedforklift. All of our rough terrain forklifts incorporate designs & features that make our products stand out from the competition.

An alternative to class 3s, tuggers can pull large loads without requiring the equipment to lift it off the ground to do it.
