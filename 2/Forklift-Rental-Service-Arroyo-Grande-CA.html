<p>The walk-behind pallet stacker is basically a forklift with a mast, operating on battery power. Many forklifts have an automatic alarm that will sound when you travel in reverse. Our Forklift Service department and Forklift Parts department is proud to offer service and parts for all major forklift brands. The larger tires allowed by lifted trucks is one of the biggest advantages for going off-road with this type of vehicle.</p>
<p>Drive the forklift forwards and backwards and in a figure eight pattern, stopping and starting in order to test the responsiveness of steering and braking. They are smaller than most forklifts and so are able to manoeuvre in those hard-to-reach areas. Forget parking garages, and height clearance could become an issue in some drive thrus.

<h3>5k Warehouse Forklift Specs Arroyo Grande CA</h3>
<p>Because there is no load, the center of gravity is nearly in the center of the forklift's counterbalance. We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs. Used in different warehouses and go-downs, the offered pallet truck is known for its excellent load carrying capacity. While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>
<p>Seasonal: Many businesses are cyclical in nature, and to maximize your capital expenditures, renting an extra lift truck to help you through the surge of your seasonal business is the right decision. With so many options available to you, the best way to make sure you find lifted trucks that work for what you need is through a knowledgeable and experienced dealer that specializes in these kinds of vehicles.</p>

Generally speaking the reach truck will be less expensive new, used or leased than a sit-down forklift but the real value is in increased warehouse productivity. At United Equipment, we offer a wide range of Cat and Elevah order pickers for sale, the ideal pickers for high, narrow or tricky-to-navigate spaces.</p>
