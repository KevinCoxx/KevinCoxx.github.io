Internal combustion (IC) forklifts are powered by a traditional engine that runs on one of several types of fuel: compressed gasses or diesel.</p>

The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
