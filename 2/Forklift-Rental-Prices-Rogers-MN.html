Not move the truck and remain at the controls at all times, if operating an industrial lift truck with a forklift platform with an employee on the platform.

<p>The following particularly applies to pallet trucks with a platform: Many ergonomic elements and functions make it easier to operate the truck.

Guide Rails - Guide rails are essential equipment that prevents an order picking truck from ramming into storage racks.</p>
<p>If the operator must frequently enter and exit the forklift to access product, build pallets, etc. Ask what kind of lift it is, who installed it and if there have been any problems with it. Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>

When it's done right, you can expect a lifted Jeep to have better pulling power, a greater capacity to off-road because of its increased clearance, and the ability to use a much larger set of off-road tires.</p>
