<p>With so many different types of forklifts , your workplace efficiency and productivity depends on selecting the right equipment for your needs. Dayton hand hydraulic pallet trucks are manually operated industrial duty products designed to lift maximum weight. Roe Osborn Rough terrain forklifts (or telehandlers) were designed to move material from off-loading zones closer to jobsites and to lift manageable loads to elevated work areas. Buyer beware takes on particular importance when it comes to forklifts.</p>
<p>These are Sit-down forklifts designed for indoor use with solid, cushioned tires â€” powered by internal-combustion (IC) engines that run on diesel fuel or, more commonly, LP gas. You don't want a truck that was lifted by some random mechanic since there is no guarantee the mechanic knows what he or she is doing. Since they can easily move from indoor to exterior jobs, these machines are remarkably flexible.</p>

<p>Despite being used, all of our rough terrain forklifts are of a high standard. However, forklift trucks come in a number of different sizes and models.

<p>Our counterbalance forklift training courses follow a specific set of guidelines as determined by NPORS & ITSSAR to ensure your staff are trained to the highest standard. They have dual forks at the front of the truck and a weight in the back to offset the weight of the load in the front.

<p>Beyond that, many workers can also be injured when (1) lift trucks are inadvertently driven off loading docks; (2) lifts fall between docks and an unsecured trailer; (3) they are struck by a lift truck; or (4) they fall while on elevated pallets and tines. While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.</p>
