Regardless of your equipment and operational requirements, our service team can provide you with the perfect solution for your needs. That would be lifted pickup trucks. The following tests represent minimum stability requirements for order picker trucks with traction control on the lifting device, and not restrained by external means, having rated capacities up to and including 10,000 pounds at a 24 inch load center.</p>
<p>Unlike other online shops, our customer support representatives are actual mechanics who are seasoned in fitting, installing, and maintaining truck and SUV air suspension. For instance, if a heavy load brings the center of gravity all the way to the front axle — the theoretical edge of the stability triangle — sudden braking could shift the load forward and out of the triangle altogether.</p>
