<p>Any time the forklift's center of gravity moves outside the stability triangle, the lift will tip over. Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late. Southeast Forklifts specializes in high quality, thoroughly inspected and reconditioned equipment you can trust.
