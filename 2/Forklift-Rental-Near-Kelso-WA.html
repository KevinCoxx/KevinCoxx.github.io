<p>Order picking trucks have a working platform that helps the operator to control the lift. Servicing industries including roadwork, forestry, agriculture, stock picking and more, we're Northern California's go-to source for Cat, Clark, Mitsubishi and other allied brand forklifts. Order Pickers : Use: Order picker trucks place the operator on an elevating platform along with the forks. 2It will probably be necessary to cover the surface of the tilting platform with a friction-increasing material such as liquid paint, adhesive applied tape containing friction material, or safety tread with perforated buttons.</p>
<p>When you need power out of your forklifts, turn to Tynan for all the power you can handle. Employers must certify that operators have received all necessary training and evaluate each operator at least once every three years. The AC motors that power order pickers deliver smooth controllable power for speedy operation and precise control, without the expensive cost of diesel fuel.</p>
