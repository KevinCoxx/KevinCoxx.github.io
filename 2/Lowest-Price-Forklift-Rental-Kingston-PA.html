This is not always a terrible thing, but it often takes some getting used to, especially if you have driven the standard model and then change to a lifted truck.

<p>Whether a complete beginner or an experienced operator, our range of forklift training benefits individuals or employees wanting to develop their skills. Like how its name says, the side loader forklift can drive up alongside pallet racks or other industrial shelving and can unload without having to turn.

Lifted trucks with a body lift have physical spacers or blocks installed between the body and the frame of the truck.</p>
