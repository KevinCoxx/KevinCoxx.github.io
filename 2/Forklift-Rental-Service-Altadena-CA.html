<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab. If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>

<h3>Forearm Forklift Altadena CA</h3>
<p>Right now, drivers absolutely love vehicles capable of off-road driving. Their decision to go with a Liftking product was in part due to the versatility of Liftking's robust rough-terrain forklift,” says Mark Aldrovandi, sales manager at Liftking. The most important things to know when you choose a forklift are its size, lift and load capacity, and configuration.</p>
<p>But where a straight mast forklift really differs is in the maneuverability and accessibility it provides through large heavy-duty pneumatic cushion tires that enable the lift to traverse rough terrain as easily as any other equipment on the job site. Our nationwide used forklift sales network brings refurbished lifts to companies and agencies at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>This is critical because loads longer than 48” will reduce the rated lifting capacity of your rental forklift. Maintenance personnel may be lifted on the forks to reach their work. One major difference between a forklift and a car is stability. That's why we invest heavily in keeping our rental fleet in optimum condition.
