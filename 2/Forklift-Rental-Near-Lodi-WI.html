Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions.

The fuel-efficient cushion tire forklifts from Cat, with lift capacities from 3,000 to 15,500 lbs., are ideal for use in indoor applications with smooth, dry floors, where moving palletized loads to and from a loading dock or storage area is required.
