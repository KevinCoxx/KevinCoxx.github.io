<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>As the name implies, reach trucks reach” into racking with an extendable carriage and forks to grab pallets that range from 2,500 to 5,500 lbs. This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The choice to lift your truck or not is ultimately going to come down to what you use the vehicle for and what you hope to get out of lifting it. If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>

<p>You can set them up with work-saver forks (roughly about 9” wide), and they lift pallets some few inches from the ground. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
<p>Some new equipment dealerships may have used forklifts that were part of a trade-in. Sometimes the outriggers on a standard walkie reach truck can get in the way of picking loads up. To get around this issue, the counterbalanced stacker has a longer chassis to increase leverage. Forklifts are responsible for only 1% of all warehouse or factory accidents.
