<p>This course is designed to provide experienced operators with relevant knowledge and understanding of practical use of the Industrial Counterbalance Forklift. Gas forklifts constantly need to be refilled, so the recurring need to purchase fuel makes the long-term costs hefty. If you are a forklift operator, be sure to fasten your seat belt before moving the equipment. They're the most common type of cargo transport truck in stores, but they're also popular in warehouses and distribution centers, too. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical or at full rearward till, whichever is less stable.</p>
<p>That's why our focus is making the forklift rental process quick and easy, without the usual red tape and fine print of the big rental companies. The 37-inch-wide C-G chassis—about five to six inches narrower than the chassis of a typical 4,000 to 7,000 lb. forklift—allows C-G Series forklifts to navigate tight rack storage aisles. Our stores in Sacramento, CA and throughout northern central California are fully equipped to meet your demands for rental forklifts.</p>
