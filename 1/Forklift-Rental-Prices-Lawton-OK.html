The most important part of choosing shocks for a lifted truck (besides knowing your truck's year, make, and model) is making sure you know the correct lift height. Linde offers a wide range of order picking equipment to suit all shelf heights, aisle widths, and order-picking methods.</p>
<p>Unless you are very experienced and know what to look for when inspecting a forklift, have a qualified mechanic or knowledgeable operator carry out the inspection. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. OSHA defines a powered industrial truck (PIT) as any mobile, power-propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, whether ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator.</p>
