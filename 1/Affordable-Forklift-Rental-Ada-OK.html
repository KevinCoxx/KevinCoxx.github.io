The correct capacity will narrow your used forklift for sale search down to a couple of models. Smaller in size when compared to pneumatic tire forklift of equal capacity.

Also called a pump truck, a pallet jack is smaller in size than the above mentioned forklifts.</p>

Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load.
