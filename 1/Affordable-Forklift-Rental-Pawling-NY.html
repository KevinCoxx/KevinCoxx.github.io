We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>Canada and Mexico are the largest export countries for U.S. forklift manufacturers, according to ITA. The growth of the region is due to the demand for modern material handling equipment across industries such as construction, mining, food, and beverage, etc. If you find anything wrong with the forklift during the walk-around or seated inspection, do not operate it until it has been repaired.</p>
