<p>The dealer insures the equipment, but you or your company must cover the operator, other workers and the facility itself in case of an injury or property damage when using the rented forklift. Our forklifts are ready for immediate pickup or delivery. While lift kits can certainly increase utility, function and style for many truck owners, there are a few safety issues to consider first.</p>
<p>In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension.</p>
