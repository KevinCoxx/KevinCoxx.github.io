<p>There are many ways in which Linde is driving the development of its pallet trucks and pallet lift trucks forward. Rough terrain forklifts are designed for two things: lifting and moving loads.

If you're working full time, we understand that it's difficult to get the time off to be able to complete an order picker training course and that's why we offer weekend LO licence courses regularly.</p>
<p>Imagine the devastation of crashing with a semi-truck - that's the kind of damage you can expect from a lifted vehicle. Teletrucks, a new type of forklift, have an extending mast that is connected to a boom instead of a straight mast, giving them a wider range of motion. All rough terrain forklifts have a backrest that keeps the load in place. Ask the seller whether the forklift for sale is in usable condition, that the forks, mast, back rest, seat, chain and tires are undamaged, and if it has been involved in any accidents.</p>
