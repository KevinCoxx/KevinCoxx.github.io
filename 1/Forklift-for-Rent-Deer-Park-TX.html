<h2>Industrial Lift Truck Deer Park</h2>

We're here to let you know what sets lifted trucks apart from other pickups on the road - it's more than just the style and the ride height.</p>
<p>Choosing the right forklift for your business can be challenging and time consuming. How forklifts operate differently from a car. Their lift trucks start at 2,500 lbs weight lifts and go upwards of 125,000. For over 50 years, Liftking has grown to be the home of a complete line of Rough Terrain forklifts for both commercial and military clients. Stockpickers are used at elevations higher than the second level of racking in a warehouse or distribution center.</p>
<p>Five new forklift models - with load capacities from 1.4 - 2.5 tons - deliver class-leading performance, and lift heights up to 13 metres. Counterbalance forklift trucks are majorly preferred for use in applications where space is limited due to their effective maneuverability. A body lift increases the truck's ride height without changing the suspension, making them a good choice for light off-roading and adding a touch of style.</p>
