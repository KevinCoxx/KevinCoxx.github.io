<p>Forklift is a powered industrial truck used to lift and move materials in warehouses and yards. This is not always a terrible thing, but it often takes some getting used to, especially if you have driven the standard model and then change to a lifted truck. Fuel cell forklifts also produce no local emissions, can be refueled in 3 minutes, and are often used in refrigerated warehouses as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures.</p>

<p>There are also variants that features a stand-up forklift, which makes it easier for operators to hop on and off between loads.

While moving palletized loads is fastest and easiest, these machines can load and unload a variety of objects.</p>
<p>However, uneven loads and those that exceed the machine's capacity can cause problems. This will give the lifted truck shopper an idea of how much off-roading the truck has endured.
