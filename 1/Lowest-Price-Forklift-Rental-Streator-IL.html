These calculations take into account variations in design including tire, mast, and other deflections, and provide a means for predicting with reasonable accuracy the stability of fork trucks.

<p>Canada and Mexico are the largest export countries for U.S. forklift manufacturers, according to ITA.

<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts help your crew move materials, supplies, and workers safely. Order pickers fit into many different types of warehouse operation processes. We guarantee that our counterbalance forklift trucks will ensure that your fleet is prepared for any application, in any environment, at any time - day or night. The most commonly used capabilities range from 3,000-6,000 pound components, however forklifts can range anywhere from 2,000-65,000 lbs or more.</p>
